# Spotify Cross-Platform Listening Behaviour Analysis

## Project Overview

A data science project investigating how listening behaviour varies across Spotify's platforms (mobile, desktop, TV, smart speakers) to inform product development decisions for Platform & Partner Experience teams.

**Key Research Questions:**
1. How does listening behaviour differ across platforms?
2. What factors predict platform choice for different listening contexts?
3. How do engagement metrics vary by platform and time of day?

## Ethical Considerations

This project uses data from consenting participants who authorised access to their Spotify listening history. All data is:
- ✅ Collected with explicit consent
- ✅ Completely anonymised in public repositories
- ✅ Aggregated to prevent individual identification
- ✅ Used solely for learning and research purposes

See [ETHICS.md](docs/ETHICS.md) for full details.
